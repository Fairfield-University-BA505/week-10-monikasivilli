# Part 3: Pandas DataFrames
## Theory: You should know ...
* How Pandas extends Python to provide better for support for structuring real world data
* How Pandas input and output works

## Practice: You be able to ...
* Create and populate Pandas DataFrames from data files
* Calculate values in Pandas
* Read and write CSV files using Pandas

## Instructions
1. __Open the `HealthStatsPart4.ipynb` file in Jupyter.__ The file already has the corrected Python code from class.
2. __Use Pandas's I/O functions to import the raw data from the CSV file.__ Make sure to use `dtype`s to name and type the columns while reading the file.
3. __For the calculations step, have Pandas use the data in the DataFrame.__ Use Pandas to calculate the `W2H_Ratio` and `Shape`. Get the logic of the calculations from the previous two parts.
4. __Use DataFrame's I/O functions to present your results.__ Render the HTML for Jupyter and export to the CSV file `complete_w2h.csv`.
